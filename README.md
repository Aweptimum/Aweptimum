# Howdy ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sam, a backend developer with a degree in mechanical engineering

I'm fascinated by math, geometry, data structures, and the systems behind video games

I'm currently porting composer to lua because I'm that desperate for a good package manger

## My languages:
 - Lua
 - PHP
 - Typescript
 - R
## My tools:
 - TimescaleDB (Postgres but even better)
 - Symfony + Doctrine
 - Git (but you probably figured that out)
 - Azure
 - LÃ–VE
